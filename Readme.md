# Woodcrafting Project

This project is a practical exploration into the backend of web development. It was created to enhance understanding and gain hands-on experience with various technologies.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- Express: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- Prisma: An open-source database toolkit.

Through this project, I've gained a deeper understanding of how these technologies interact to build robust backend systems.
